    <h1>October 21</h1>
    <p>Today I created my journal which I have not yet linked to my mundane personal website. I have spent a whole lab period doing this and it has mostly consisted of picking font styles and colors. Now I am finally writing the entry and after this entry I will pick a font color for this entry. I am still dissapointed that my idea for the free room is limited to many buttons instead of anywhere on a frame, but I will learn to get over it.</p>
