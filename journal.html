        <p>Today I created my journal which I have not yet linked to my mundane personal website. I have spent a whole lab period doing this and it has mostly consisted of picking font styles and colors. Now I am finally writing the entry and after this entry I will pick a font color for this entry. I am still dissapointed that my idea for the free room is limited to many buttons instead of anywhere on a frame, but I will learn to get over it.</p>

        <p1>Over the past few weeks, I have made my frame and grid in scratch. Each of the lines is of a different color and if another key is pressed when the program is in the middle of forming a line, then a randomized squiggle appears so it meets both points: the one originally pressed and the one pressed midway through. I have not figured out how to make a curve to another point. And now I finally look at classes and see that we have some "fizzbuzz" thing. I did not have class on Monday, so I am wondering if I am supposed to do that. I really hope it was not important because I am not great on statring projects on my own. Oh well, what's done is done.</p1>

        <p>Today is a Monday, so I have had Computer Science class today. I have not updated my journal in a very long time, but that does not mean it have not done work between then and now. I am just lazy and keep forgetting about the journal and think more about my projects. I also really do not like writing down my thoughts because I think WAY faster than I type. Today I am thinking about my Fizzbuzz project. I have almost finished the basics, I got it to say both fizz and buzz, but I have not yet made it say fizzbuzz. I also still want to add the feature where a black bubble drops every time it is fizz and a white colored bubbles drop every time the counter hits buzz, and finally brown sugar syrup everytime it hits fizzbuzz. I am not sure how to cancel out the fizz and the buzz and instead put fizzbuzz because whenever I do it reverts back to not being able to do fizz or buzz! I really only focus on one project at a time, in other words I have tunnel vision, so I have not been able to work on another project because the fizzbuzz project will just pop into my brain and annoy me. I also am still extremely confused with java script. I learn best with memorization and I am having a hard time learing/memorizing how to do it because I just have to sit and listen instead of take notes. I know Molly does not like conventional teaching methods, but I thrive on those, I thrive on taking notes. I am really worried about my grade because I have only worked on the fizzbuzz and have not learned any java script, but I will accept what comes no matter how upset it will make me. I am sorry if this feels like a personal attack, but I am frustrated and please do not feel offended.</p>

        I did not really work much on my projects today, but I have been thinking a lot on the design I want to give to my personal website because all it is now is just a header and a couple of links. What I want to do is make the link a div depicting something that I have drawn. I also want to add an event listener so when the div is hovered over a precoded thing occurs specific to the project. Like for my rainbow grid, I want a rainbow to form that crosses the entire page and keeps changing colors. For my fizz buzz, I want the div to look like it is dispensing bubbles and the entire background be the color of tea. For the bubble tea array and angry blueberry codes, I still have no idea.

        <p>I have been updating this journal a lot recently, and I realized that the header of each day just keeps getting smaller and smaller with each entry. I can not get it to stop! and what is weird is the the text size within each journal entry is the same size. Why?!?! After this, I decided to just change my new header style altogether as a temporary replacement until I can figure this out </p>

        <p>I decided to work on my array in lab instead of fixing my journal. I figured it would be easier to fix my journal on my own. I finally understand what a variable does in java script and how math.random works, but I still have not had the time to add it it my array. My website is being checked tomorrow. I think I am just going to put all of the projects that I have made projgress on, even though I have not finished them.</p>
