Goal/Directions/Plan

1. Make a functions call "make starling" that shows a picture of an animal. Add a subsection of i + 1 to generate multiple. I would then generate their position with an array of x and y coordinates or use math.random to generate the positions, but limit it to whole numbers with. Then I would add an event listener of when command r is pressed, so that when the page is reloaded then are in different positions.
2. 
3. I would add an event listener that so when anywhere on the screen is clicked, the starlings' opacity would be zero. Or maybe when a certain amount of time has passed make them literally fly off of the screen.
